## Observations

As discussed, I tried training on the good slots. 
These slots have clash number of 0 and have more than the average courses.
However, the min clashes tend to increase after I update one 
timeslot randomly the min clashes are increasing.
Seems something is not right. I will change the strategies in the future and 
try again.
